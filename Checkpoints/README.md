The files beginning by *score_history* are the training history of the agent with the parameters and the score target to which they were trained. They can be plotted using the module `plot_saved_results.py`. The other files are checkpoints (saved weights) at different scores like *score_x_at...* and the last part of the file name says which kind of network they correspond to.  Also, the files with *hidden_d* and *True* in their name correspond to the `MHQ-DFQNetwork` version with `DFQNetwork` having a hidden layer and the Time Aware version, respectively.
